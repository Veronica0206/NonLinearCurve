# NonLinearCurve

***NonLinearCurve* Package contains the functions for models developed in my dissertation and extension projects.  In these functions, we provide functions capable of 'calculating' starting values from the input and generate the estimates described in the manuscripts.**

Please refer to the [Example Code File](https://github.com/Veronica0206/NonLinearCurve/blob/main/test.R) for model implement.
